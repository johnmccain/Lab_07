LinkedList bug guesses

Bug 1: m_size is defined as 1 rather than 0 on creation of a new LinkedList

Bug 2: isEmpty always returns false

Bug 3: addBack doesn't add the desired element, rather copies the first element and places it again at the back

Bug 4: removeFront doesn't remove the front element, it removes the back element
